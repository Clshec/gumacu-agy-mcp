# Verified ChatGPT MCP tool refresh procedure

Verified on 18 October 2026: 26 tools became 28 in the SAME existing conversation.

## What made the tools visible

1. Deploy the tested commit to the actual Linux MCP Python environment. A GitHub merge alone does not deploy or reload code.
2. Restart the device gateway before reloading MCP, so its authenticated registry publishes current allowed_actions.
3. Reload only the managed gumacu-netcup tunnel/MCP runtime, retaining the tracked stdio_reconnect launcher.
4. In ChatGPT use **Settings → Plugins → netcup → Manage app → Refresh tools**.
5. Inspect the plugin app action list, then the assistant's callable inventory. Allow the update to propagate and recheck. Invoke the new tools through native MCP.

The pre-existing **Allow all** permission was unchanged. Development mode, private tunnel identity and credentials were unchanged. No new chat, reinstall, key replacement or Telegram restart was needed in this rollout. A new conversation is only a fallback if the existing conversation does not receive the refreshed inventory.

This client refresh procedure is consistent with [OpenAI's connection/testing guide](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/deploy/connect-chatgpt). UI labels may change; the verified path above records the observed interface.

## Three different acceptance layers

| Layer | Required proof |
|---|---|
| Server | Actual tools/list contains expected tool names and schemas |
| ChatGPT registration | Plugin detail's app action list contains new tools |
| Assistant | Callable inventory includes new tools AND native connector calls succeed |

Server counts, UI visibility, package version and tunnel ready=true are individually insufficient to prove assistant access.

The verified native calls were:

```text
agy_capabilities({})
agy_dispatch({"device_id":"linux-netcup","action":"doctor","arguments":{}})
```

Discovery reported linux-netcup and windows-main online; dispatch returned success=true and report.healthy=true. Both names appeared in the assistant's actual callable inventory, with 28 Netcup tools total. Production commit: fe0734d8247256ff12f73b6a8b8155b9ac6c525a.

## Safe deployment and tunnel reload

Record source commit, active jobs and service PIDs. Back up source, sessions, broker configuration and launcher privately. Preserve job owner processes; choose a safe reload if MCP owns active workers. Never print credentials.

Deploy the tested commit to /opt/gumacu-agy-mcp/source and its existing venv. Install deploy/run-mcp.sh as the production launcher. It must run python -m agy_mcp.stdio_reconnect. Restart gumacu-agy-gateway.service for broker changes. Keep the independent gumacu-agy-telegram.service running, with exactly one Telegram poller.

In Windows PowerShell, supply the existing runtime directory and use the managed runtime API rather than broad process kills:

```powershell
$client = Join-Path $runtimeDirectory 'bin\tunnel-client.exe'
& $client runtimes stop gumacu-netcup --json | Out-Null
Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'Gumacu Secure MCP Tunnel Watchdog'

# Inspect after recovery. The local health port is dynamically assigned.
$status = & $client runtimes status gumacu-netcup --json | ConvertFrom-Json
$status | Select-Object process_running, healthy, ready, mcp_health_url
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $status.mcp_health_url
```

Run as the credential-owning user; recovery after a Windows reboot requires login. Do not run its DPAPI credential as SYSTEM. See [tunnel recovery](tunnel-recovery.md).

The old runbook's fixed port, broad process termination, mandatory new-chat step and claim that tools/list happens only at tunnel startup are superseded. They are not reliable assumptions for future releases.

## Future updates

| Change | Procedure |
|---|---|
| New public MCP tool or changed schema/description | Deploy/reload MCP, refresh ChatGPT registration, verify native invocation |
| New device/action behind stable agy_capabilities and agy_dispatch | Deploy broker/agent implementation and allowlist; call discovery again |
| Internal implementation with unchanged definitions | Reload affected component and verify behavior |
| Broken transport or missing initialization | Repair connectivity/initialization; schema refresh alone cannot repair it |

Keep the two facade schemas stable. New backend actions still require implementation, authorization and deployment. They do not automatically become new top-level MCP tools. See [dynamic gateway](dynamic-capability-gateway.md).

A tools.listChanged capability or notification is not proof that this client refreshed. Likewise /health/mcp may lack protocol observations while native calls work. Do not infer success or failure from that signal alone. The release gate's successful GitHub Action is a reminder, not proof that someone completed its manual acceptance checklist.

## التفسير العملي بالعربي

الإجراء الذي استخدمناه هو **Refresh tools** في إعدادات إضافة netcup، بعد نشر النسخة وإعادة اتصال MCP. صلاحية **Allow all** كانت موجودة أصلًا ولم نغيّرها. ظهرت الأداتان داخل نفس المحادثة ثم استُدعيتا عبر MCP فعلًا.

في التحديثات القادمة: إضافة أداة MCP جديدة تتطلب تحديث التسجيل والتحقق. أما إضافة قدرة خلف الأداتين الثابتتين فتتطلب نشرها ثم استدعاء agy_capabilities، دون تغيير تعريف أدوات MCP. لا توجد مهلة انتشار ثابتة مضمونة؛ نتحقق من الظهور والاستدعاء بدل الاكتفاء بالانتظار.
